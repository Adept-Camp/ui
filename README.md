# Wild Cards web app

## Basic Usage

\*\* Make sure you're using Node v10

If you have forgotten to switch to Node v10 delete and re-install you node_modules

```
npm start
```

For development, using the [vs-code reason plugin](https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server) your code should reload on every save.

If however you don't use such a plugin you can still watch for file changes using the following command:

```
npm run re:watch
```

### Build for production

npm run build
```

### Test

npm run test
```
